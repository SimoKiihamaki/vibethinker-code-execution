# Optimized Test Repository

This is an optimized test repository for enhanced MLX integration testing with performance optimizations.

## Features

- ✅ Optimized data structures (Map vs Object)
- ✅ Intelligent caching layer
- ✅ Batch processing capabilities
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Code optimization tools
- ✅ Webpack bundling for production

## Performance Optimizations

### Data Structure Optimization
- Replaced Object with Map for O(1) lookups
- Added intelligent caching with automatic invalidation
- Implemented batch operations for bulk processing

### Memory Management
- Efficient memory usage with Map.clear()
- Automatic garbage collection hints
- Memory usage monitoring

### Code Optimization
- Automated optimization scripts
- Unused code removal
- Loop optimization
- Function inlining

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
